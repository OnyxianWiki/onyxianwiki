## Technologies:
The wiki is based on Docusaurus ( https://docusaurus.io ), which is built with next ( https://nextjs.org/ ) that uses react ( https://es.reactjs.org/ )

The documentation is written in MDX ( https://mdxjs.com/ ).

Docusaurus Styling is provided by Infima (https://infima.dev/). I customize general Styling with SASS ( https://sass-lang.com/ ), & do component-specific styling with Styled Components ( https://styled-components.com/ ).

The main component framework used is material UI ( https://material-ui.com/ ).
