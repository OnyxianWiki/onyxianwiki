## Server software
This plugin has been tested and works without issues on Spigot & Paper, and it is likely to work on any server jar that is a fork of CraftBukkit.

## Server version
The plugin has been tested on 1.16.5, it is likely that it works on any server version, BUT, you might need to change the configuration on older versions, since some potion effects & entity types didn't exist in older versions and others were called differently.

To my knowledge, this plugin doesn't conflict with any other plugins, and it's highly unlikely that it ever will.
