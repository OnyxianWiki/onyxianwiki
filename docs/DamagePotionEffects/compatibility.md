## Server Software
This plugin has been tested and works without issues on Spigot & Paper, and it is likely to work on any server jar that is a fork of CraftBukkit.

## Minecraft Versions
The plugin has been tested on 1.16.5, it probably works on any server version, BUT, you might need to change the configuration at older minecraft versions, since some potion effects & entity types have been renamed.

## Plugin compatibilities
To my knowledge, this plugin doesn't conflict with any other plugins, and it's highly unlikely that it ever will.
