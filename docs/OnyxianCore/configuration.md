## Summaryg

The configuration of the Onyxian Core is split across 3 files:
- **config.yml** contains general configuration settings that determine how the plugin works.
- **actions.yml** contains actions, that can be used by plugins that use the onyxian core.
- **variables.yml** contains variables, that can be used as parameters, by plugins that use the Onyxian Core. They can also be used by actionables.



## Examples
If you need examples, please check the default config that's created when you install the plugin, also located inside the plugin jar
