Since my most advanced plugins require it in order to function, the Onyxian Core is automatically downloaded, activated, & used by any plugins that require it.

If for some reason, one of my plugins cannot download the Onyxian Core, you can manually install it just like any other plugin:
1. Download it from <a href="https://github.com/OnyxianSoul/OnyxianCoreJars/releases">here</a>
2. Stop the server
3. Drop the jar on your plugins folder
4. Start the server
