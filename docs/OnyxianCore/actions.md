## What are they?
Actions are anything that can be executed to do something on the server, for example, sending a console message, healing someone, placing a block, etc.

Each action has parameters that can be used to modify how/when/what they apply to, and what they do exactly.
Additionally, actions can take variables as parameters


The Onyxian Core comes with a lot of built-in action types, and they can take parameters to change what they do, making it so you can do basically anything with them.
