## TLDR
The Onyxian Core is a plugin provided & used by my most complex plugins. It is a flexible and advanced tool:
- It increases the capabilities of all the plugins that use it
- It reduces configuration work for server owners
- It allows developers to interact or expand multiple Onyxian Plugins at the same time
- It makes it easier to add & mantain new features that you can use.
